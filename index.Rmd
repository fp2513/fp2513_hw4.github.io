Image pulled from internet, with the web address

This is an awesome website about data science and elmo?

Sometimes I use [google](https://www.google.com/) to do data science when I'm stuck.
(inside square brackets will show up on website where as the inside the round brackets is the link that will open up when they click)

But can also pull from repository and put directly into the website --> using ![](image.jpg) given that the image is in my repo 

These are not going into code chunks!

You can define a site wide formatting, rather than trying to set up from scratch can set it up just once
