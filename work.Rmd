# Let's build something better.


I strongly believe that public health has a responsibility to make sure that what we work towards does no harm and I try to be as ethical as I can in taking on projects.



If your organisation represents clinical trial fraud, or concealing data and monetises public health needs, then I am probably not the best fit for your project. All that said, if you are looking for help building something that promotes sustainability, collaboration, or generally aims to make a positive impact for all, then letâ€™s talk.
