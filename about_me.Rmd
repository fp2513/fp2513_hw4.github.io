Growing up in Auckland, New Zealand, I was always encouraged to think broadly and critically, cultivating a curiosity about the world beyond my island home. Auckland may not immediately come to mind as a hub for world-leading research, but it instilled in me a strong sense of curiosity and a desire to understand how we know what we know—and who or what drives that knowledge forward.

Upon graduating from high school, I moved to London to study Immunology and Infection at University College London, where I earned a First Class Honors degree in 2024. During my studies, I developed a keen interest in the dual role of statistics in both generating and validating scientific knowledge. This led to my dissertation focus on data wrangling and pattern discovery in tuberculosis blood samples. Rather than relying on predictive modeling, I worked to understand complex datasets and uncover valuable information directly from the data itself. This approach highlighted for me the vast potential within raw data, often overlooked in the age of Big Data’s emphasis on modeling.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Biostatistics at Columbia University in New York City. I look forward to applying my background in immunology and statistical analysis to deepen our understanding of biomedical data, aiming to bridge the gap between data acquisition and insightful discovery.

# Fashion 

Beyond data science, I am drawn to fashion, particularly in how people use it to express their identities. Fashion choices—whether someone consistently avoids the color black, wears a specific necklace, or matches ties and socks—offer unique insights into individual personality and values.

Lately, I’ve become intrigued by how the fashion industry cycles through trends over time, and I want to challenge the stereotype of the “unfashionable data scientist” by exploring the intersection of biostatistics and fashion. One idea I’m passionate about is leveraging body scanning data to enhance sizing inclusivity. Currently, standard sizing models are often based on outdated assumptions that don’t represent the diversity of real body shapes. With body scanning technology and data science, fashion brands could analyze diverse body types to create more inclusive, accurate sizing charts. Machine learning can process large sets of body shape data, revealing commonalities and differences that can inform better-fitting, more comfortable designs.
